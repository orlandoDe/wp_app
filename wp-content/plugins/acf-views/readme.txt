== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I display user fields? =

Yes, you set up your field groups in ACF and assign those fields to your View, paste the shortcode in the target place, add the object-id="$user$" argument to the shortcode to display the fields from the current user. See [here](https://docs.acfviews.com/shortcode-attributes/view-shortcode) for more about shortcode arguments.

= Can I display fields from my options page? =

Yes, you set up your field groups in ACF and assign those fields to your View, paste the shortcode in the target place, add the object-id="options" argument to the shortcode to display the fields from the options page. See [here](https://docs.acfviews.com/shortcode-attributes/view-shortcode) for more about shortcode arguments.

= Fields have been assigned but the page doesn't show them =

Have you checked that the fields are filled in the target object? See [steps](https://docs.acfviews.com/getting-started/introduction/creating-your-first-view) for creating a View.

= Can I display fields inside the Gutenberg Query Loop? =

You can use the View shortcode inside the Gutenberg Query Loop element. Please make sure you've added it via the built-in Shortcode block, as it won't work properly with other block types, like Code or Custom HTML.
